#Backbone.Tuxedo

The saying goes "Underscore is the tie to go along with jQuery's tux, and Backbone.js's suspenders."  
Well I say Backbone can have its own tux!


## About Tuxedo

Backbone.Tuxedo is a composite component library for Backbone.js that
aims to simplify the construction of large scale JavaScript applications. 
It is a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in 
the applications that I (Anthony Howell) have been building with Backbone, 
and includes various types of UI components.
